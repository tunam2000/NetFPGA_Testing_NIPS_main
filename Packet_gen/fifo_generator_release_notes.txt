INTRODUCTION
============
Thank you using the FIFO Generator core from Xilinx!  
In order to obtain the latest core updates and documentation, 
please visit the Intellectual Property page located at:
http://www.xilinx.com/ipcenter/index.htm
This document contains the release notes for FIFO Generator v3.2
which includes enhancements, resolved issues and outstanding known
issues.  For release notes and known issues for CORE Generator 8.2i IP
Update 2 and FIFO Generator v3.2 please see Answer Record 23831.

RELEASE NOTES
=============
This section lists any enhancements, resolved issues and outstanding
known issues.


1. General Core Design
  1.1 Enhancements
    1.1.1 Added Support for Spartan(TM)-3A, Spartan-3 XA, Spartan-3E XA, and 
           Virtex(TM)-4 XA

    1.1.2 Added Support for synchronous reset for Common Clock Block RAM and 
          Distributed RAM implementations

  1.2 Resolved Issues
    1.2.1 Cleaned-up the power-on states of the flags in common clock Block RAM 
          and Distributed RAM FIFOs. The flags now start in a valid state on 
          power-up and the FIFO is ready to be written on the very first clock 
          edge.
          Change request: 423373

  1.3 Outstanding Issues
    1.3.1 Coregen GUI - For Block RAM and Distributed RAM FIFOs, if the reset pin 
          is not chosen, the reset type text in page 6 of the GUI (summary) is
          displayed as "Asynchronous" instead of "Not Selected".
          Change request: 423076

2. General Simulation
  2.1 Enhancements
      None at this time.

  2.2 Resolved Issues
    2.2.1 VHDL Behavioral model simulation fails for incorrect FIFO
          implementation types
          Simulations using the VHDL behavioral model issue a failure message
          intended only for Virtex-4 and Virtex-5 built-in FIFO types. 
          Change request: 422741

    2.2.2 UNDERFLOW flag asserting unexpectedly 
          Verilog Behavioral model simulation of a First-Word-Fall-Through
          FIFO with Independent Clocks asserts the UNDERFLOW flag unexpectedly.
 	  Change request: 419555   
	
    2.2.3 VHDL Behavioral Simulation failure with a message, "Array lengths 
          do not match", for the WR_DATA_COUNT flag for a First-Word-Fall-Through
          FIFO with asymmetric ports and "Use Extra Logic" option.
          Change request: 415411

  2.3 Outstanding Issues
    2.3.1 Ncelab warnings during Verilog structural and timing simulations in ncsim
          for Virtex5 Block RAM FIFOs. 
          The simulations will be successful, but there will be warnings similar to 
          the following in the log file: "memory index out of declared bounds" in 
          simprims_ver_virtex5_source.v or unisims_ver_virtex5_source.v.
          Cadence does not want to fix this issue. These warning messages can safely 
          be ignored.
          Change request: 423374, 423375

3. Documentation
  3.1 Enhancements
    3.1.1 Added a table describing the reset and power-on values for all output ports.

  3.2 Resolved Issues
      None at this time.
      
  3.3 Outstanding Issues
      None at this time.
